<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Astroparticle &amp; Cosmologie (APC) laboratory invites applications for a postdoctoral position in cosmology. The successful candidate will collaborate with Dr. Eric Aubourg (PI of the <strong><em>AstroDeep</em></strong> ANR), Dr. Cécile Roucelle and Dr. Alexandre Boucaud on the development of cutting-edge probabilistic machine learning methods for measuring weak gravitational lensing. The successful candidate will join the <strong><em>AstroDeep</em></strong> team composed of experts in weak-lensing, statistics, Bayesian neural networks and other related fields, located in France and the USA. The objective of this postdoctoral research is to develop and implement image processing methods in a Bayesian deep learning framework to compute weak-lensing observables for the upcoming large scale cosmological surveys Euclid and LSST. These methods shall be tested on simulations and existing public data (HST, DES, HSC). To that end, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to join the LSST and Euclid consortia.</p>

<p>The candidate should hold a PhD in either physics/astrophysics, engineering, mathematics or computer science. Candidates with either a scientific or technical background are welcome to apply. Our group is committed to diversity and equality,and encourage applications from women and underrepresented minorities. We support a flexible and family-friendly work environment. The position includes an internationally competitive salary and generous travel budget. French language skills are not required. Applicants should send a CV and research statement to Eric Aubourg, and arrange for three reference letters to be sent to the same email addresses before the application deadline.</p>

<p>Benefits for this position include retirement, health care, parental leave, vacation and sick days, subsidized meals, discount for public transport, sport and culture, French language classes.</p>

<p>APC, located in Paris center (France), in a building of Université de Paris, is a multidisciplinary lab with researchers working in five main groups: cosmology, high energy astrophysics, gravitational waves, neutrinos and theory. The candidate will join the cosmology group which has been involved for several years in the preparation of the data processing of both Euclid and LSST, and whose main research topics are weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and the cosmic microwave background.</p>
